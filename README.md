# Aileron-ML-Prediction
### Project: Aileron Deflection Prediction and Classification  

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict and classify aileron deflection, ensuring greater stability and passenger comfort during flight. For continuous prediction, we implemented regression models, including **Linear Regression, Ridge, and XGBoost**, evaluated using metrics such as **MAE, MSE, and RMSE**. In the classification approach, we discretized the variables and applied models like **Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and K-NN**, comparing their performance and interpretability.  

The initial **exploratory analysis** guided the selection of relevant features based on **correlations and distributions**, leading to more robust models. Additionally, we fine-tuned **hyperparameters** to optimize **generalization and minimize empirical error**, highlighting the effects of **regularization and model complexity** on predictive performance.
